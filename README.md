# RoutingEngine
Graph routing engine. Couple of algorithms combined in one library written in Cython

Main features:

 - Read graph from file
 - Route from A to B

What it should do:

 - take A to B points
 - return list of verticies and edges
 - return list of turns

If you are interested I can provide a support for this library
catch me on: pzabkiewicz@gmail.com

I also can be involved in commercial projects about graph and
routing algorithms.
